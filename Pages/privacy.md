## Access Logs

We do keep access logs.  This includes the IP address and user agent of who accessed the website.  You can not opt-out of this.  Access logs are kept for 5 days before being purged.

An example entry of the access log, where x.x.x.x is the IP address:

## Cookies

This website does not produce any additional cookies.  Disqus or any embeded content, however, might.

## Embedded content from other websites
